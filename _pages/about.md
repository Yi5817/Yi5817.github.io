I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Materials Science & Engineering (MSE) Department](https://mse.engineering.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Noa Marom](https://www.noamarom.com/). Iâ€™m working on applying artificial intelligence to Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP).

**Previously:** I got my MS in Computational Materials Science & Engineering at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) in 2022. I got my BS in Materials Science & Engineering at [China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)](https://en.cug.edu.cn/) in 2021.
